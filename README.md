A fork of rx320 originally written by A. Maitland Bottoms <bottoms@debian.org>   (https://people.debian.org/~bottoms/) from 2001. I can no longer find this code online any where. The last version when I forked it was 1.0-1. I am starting with 1.1.

rx320-client (1.1) 

  * Renamed project to rx320-cli to avoid confusion with Hector Peraza's rx320
    gui.
